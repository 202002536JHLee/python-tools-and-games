# Welcome to Quiz Master, a fun and interactive quiz game built in Python using the Pygame library Streamlit. 

You can try out the game here =======> https://quiz-master.streamlit.app/ 

<i> This README will provide you with all the information you need to understand the game's objective, rules, technology stack, and setup instructions. </i> 

## Game Objective and Rules 

The objective of this game is to answer the most questions correctly. Each round will have ten questions that will come from categories and difficulty levels of your choosing. Take your time as you answer the questions. There is no time limit. Above all else, have fun! You have full autonomy over the questions you receive. 
		
<i> Step 1: Select a Category </i>

You will start the game by selecting the category you want your questions to be randomly generated from. These categories could range from Entertainment to Science. Please select a category that would provide the most enjoyable experience for this round. After the game starts, you can change your category if you desire for each question. 

When a category has been selected, the first question and corresponding answer choices will appear. You will have the opportunity to change your category after previewing a question. 

<i> Step 2: Select the Level of Difficulty </i> 

For the best experience, you should select the difficulty level after selecting the category. The first question will default to the easy difficulty level. The levels of difficulty range from Easy to Medium to Hard. Please be sure to pick a level of difficulty that would provide the most enjoyable experience for you. If you change from the default difficulty level, the question will change to reflect the new chosen level. 

Please review the question before you submit your answer. When an answer has been submitted, it will count towards your final score. You will not be able to go back and change the difficulty level or category for any previous question. 

Most importantly, challenge yourself and your friends and have fun! Correct answers will be displayed for every wrong answer. At the end of the game, your score will be revealed. To start a new round, please refresh the page.

## Technology Stack 

The Quiz-Master game is developed in Python language and uses [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), which is an open-source Python library that is designed to make it easy to create web applications. It allows you to turn data scripts into shareable web apps quickly and with minimal effort. Streamlit is gaining popularity because it offers a simple and intuitive way to build interactive data-driven applications. It is mainly used for creating the user interface of the game. It allows for easy web app development with Python. Packages like Requests, used for making HTTP requests, JSON library is used for encoding and decoding JSON data are included in the project. Other general libraries like datetime, pandas, numpy, and plotly are used. 

The modules and functions used in the game development are discussed below:

The code begins with import statements to bring in the necessary libraries and packages.

get_category(): This function fetches all the available quiz categories from the Open Trivia Database API and returns them as a dictionary.

get_question(): Based on the selected category and difficulty, it returns a list of questions.

initialize_session_state(): It initializes the game state, which includes the current question index and player score, using Streamlit‚Äôs session state.

update_score(): This function compares the player's choice with the correct answer and updates the player's score accordingly. If the player's choice matches the correct answer, the score is incremented. Streamlit components like "st.success" and "st.error" are used to provide feedback to the player

UI Setup: The code sets up the user interface using Streamlit. It allows the user to select a quiz category, difficulty level, and provides options to answer questions and navigate through the quiz.

calculate_score(): This function includes most of the functionality of the application. It calculates the player‚Äôs score by comparing their choices with the correct answer and then updates the session. This part has Streamlit‚Äôs UI components for creating the game, such as st.title, st.subheader, st.sidebar, st.radio, and st.button. Inside the function, it compares player_choice with correct_answer and decides whether to increase the player's score or not. The updated player score is stored in Streamlit‚Äôs session state so that it persists across different questions in the game.

Category Selection: A Streamlit select box allows the user to choose from among the various categories that the code has retrieved.

Selection of Difficulty Level: Using a choose box, the user may select between three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard.

Question Fetching: Questions are retrieved from the API based on the chosen category and level of difficulty. The "quiz_questions" list is where these questions are processed and kept.

Question Display: The code controls how questions are shown, letting the player choose their response by pressing a radio button.

Answer Submission: The "calculate_score" function is triggered when the player submits an answer.

Getting Around the Quiz: After submitting an answer, the code shows the next question, allowing players to move around the quiz. The quiz ends and the final score is shown once every question has been answered.
